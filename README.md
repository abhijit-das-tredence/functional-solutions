## How to use this repo

- Start from **Industry** for business-aligned solutions  
- Start from **Cross-Industry** for reusable functional capabilities  
- Use **Shared Resources** for common code, models, and templates  
- Each solution folder should treat its own `docs/` as the main entry point

---

## Contribution rule

- New domain solutions → `industry/`
- New reusable solutions → `cross-industry/`
- Shared logic only → `shared-resources/`
- Avoid duplicating utilities across solutions

> This repository is part of the organization’s functional solution IP and delivery acceleration initiative.

## Getting Started

1. **Review Solution Documentation**  
   Each solution’s `docs/` folder explains the business problem, architecture, data sources, and how to run it.

2. **Explore Code**  
   Go to the `code/` folder of the solution you want to evaluate.

3. **Follow Examples**  
   Use the `examples/` for guided executions with synthetic or sample data.

---

## Best Practices

- Always keep `README.md` updated per solution.
- Include architecture diagrams where possible (in `docs/`).
- Tag code modules with platform dependencies (e.g., Snowflake, Databricks, AWS).
